        <h2>Personal Interests</h2>

        <h3>Computers</h3>

        <p>
          I'm a <abbr title="computer science">CS</abbr> student who became inspired by video games at a young age.
          My interest in programming blossomed in high school, and shortly after I began studying at <abbr title="George Fox University"><a href="https://www.georgefox.edu/" target="_blank">GFU</a></abbr>.
          To this day, I remain interested in making (and playing) computer games.
        </p>

        <h3>Art</h3>

        <p>
          Before I ever looked at a computer screen, I was interested in drawing.
          I have mounts of sketchbooks and a wall of paintings to remind me to flex my creative muscles every once in a while.
        </p>

        <h3>Music</h3>

        <p>
          Another passion of mine is music production.
          Though I never learned music theory or sheet music, my interest in sound design, audio production, and music compisition grew as I began creating original works in high school.
          I can't describe the type of music I make; you'll have to <a href="https://shoobie-doobie.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">hear it for yourself</a>.
