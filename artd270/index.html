            <p>
                This class focused on the design aspects of <abbr title="user experience">UX</abbr> rather than the technology.
                The class encouraged the process of sketching, wireframing, and <em>then</em> building a functional website.
                All projects were completed during the spring 2021 semester.

            <h2>Website Redesign</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    The first task of this project was to find a website to redesign.
                    I chose the <a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/vatican/en.html" target="blank">website of the Vatican</a> for two reasons:
                    1) I currently attend an Anglican church and have an interest in the relationship between traditional Christianity and technology, and
                    2) the website is severely outdated and in need of renovation.
                    My design process focused on the potential users of the site and how to help them accomplish their goals.
