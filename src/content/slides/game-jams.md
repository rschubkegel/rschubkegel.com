## What is a game jam?

A game jam is a challenge to create a game in a limited amount of time.

---

I like short, competitive game jams

- 48-72 hours
- Specific theme
- Team or solo

---

I get to make _everything_ (if I have time)

- Low expectations
- Low commitment
- High intensity

---

No client reviews. No unit tests. No pull requests.

Bring your favorite game engine (unless the rules say otherwise)

_Experiencing everyone else's games._
