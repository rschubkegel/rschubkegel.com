Since purchasing [Owl City's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owl_City) album [Ocean Eyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_Eyes_(album)), I have become fascinated by electronic music. Without knowing how to read music or learning more than a few chords on the guitar, I dove into the world of music production.

As early as 2012, I was using my iPod (1st gen) to record looped tracks from a electric keyboard. I learned how to create synthesizer sounds from the incredibly extensive videos of [SeamlessR](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2mgCVJWitRUTIpgd7pLung) before unearthing the wildly creative [Andrew Huang](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdcemy56JtVTrsFIOoqvV8g).

Since then, I have composed hundreds of songs and discovered my own unique sound. This page includes publicly released albums but I've also taken advantage of my musical skills in some of my [video games](/games). I hope you find a something here that inspires you!

Since I got married in 2020, my wife and I have enjoyed making music together. It's difficult to find time to finish a song together, but the few we _have_ completed are available on [Bandcamp](https://thenewbkegels.bandcamp.com/).

Taken from the nickname my baseball coach gave me, this alias has been my go-to for music projects since 2013.
