	## [Teaching](/collections/teaching)
</ProjectHeader>

I've taught some programming classes which has been a great way to practice my communications skills and review fundamental programming concepts.

Most recently I taught a high school elective at [Hill Creek Christian School](https://hillcreekchristian.org/) on _Python Programming and Computer Science_. I designed the entire curriculum from the ground up with the goal of developing students' high-level understanding and appreciation of digital technologies. All of the curriculum resources were compiled in a website built specifically for the course. You can check it out at [hcc.rschubkegel.com](https://hcc.rschubkegel.com/).

I was also an online instructor at [Coding with Kids](https://www.codingwithkids.com/) for a summer where I taught camps and after-school classes in Python, C#, and Scratch.

	## [Game Development](/collections/games)
</ProjectHeader>

My interest in video games inspired me to study computer science in college. Game development remains one of my favorite hobbies since it combines my interest in software development, visual art, music production, and psychology.
