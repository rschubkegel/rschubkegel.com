	## [Web Development](/web)
</ProjectHeader>

I am a software developer by trade and I specialize in web development. Aside from [rschubkegel.com](/), I've collected some of the other projects I've worked on.

	## Mobile Development
</ProjectHeader>

I have become very proficient with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) by working on the [BrokerBay](https://www.brokerbay.com/) mobile app as a contractor through [Silverpine](https://silverpine.com/). I have spearheaded several initiatives to improve the app, including:

- Speeding up average launch time by over 50% by refactoring <abbr title="asynchronous">async</abbr> logic
- Optimizing <abbr title="time to interactive">TTI</abbr> metrics by implementing skeleton loader components
- Adding frontend data caching using [Tanstack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest)

	## [Teaching](/teaching)
</ProjectHeader>

I've taught some programming classes which has been a great way to practice my communications skills and review fundamental programming concepts.

Most recently I taught a high school elective at [Hill Creek Christian School](https://hillcreekchristian.org/) on _Python Programming and Computer Science_. I designed the entire curriculum from the ground up with the goal of developing students' high-level understanding and appreciation of digital technologies. All of the curriculum resources were compiled in a website built specifically for the course. You can check it out at [hcc.rschubkegel.com](https://hcc.rschubkegel.com/).

I was also an online instructor at [Coding with Kids](https://www.codingwithkids.com/) for a summer where I taught camps and after-school classes in Python, C#, and Scratch.

	## [Engineering](/engineering)
</ProjectHeader>

I don't usually touch hardware with a ten foot pole, but I worked on a couple of projects in school that made me feel like a "real" engineer.

	## [Game Development](/games)
</ProjectHeader>

My interest in video games inspired me to study computer science in college. Game development remains one of my favorite hobbies since it combines my interest in software development, visual art, music production, and psychology.
