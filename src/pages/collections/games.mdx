# {frontmatter.title}

My passion for games started with the Nintendo GameCube which I **loved** playing with my older brother. I would dream about making my own games, creating experiences that didn't exist yet. Late in middle school I started making games with [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), then graduated to [XNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA) in high school. Before graduating I had created several small game with [Unity](https://unity.com/) and developed a passion for game design.

To this day, I still love making games since they provide a unique opportunity to blend my interests of programming, art, music, and psychology. I hope you enjoy one or more of the projects I've made!

I am a co-founder of Creature Games Studios, a small group of video game enthusiasts making games in our spare time.

The group was formed when creating [The Creature](https://www.creaturegamesstudio.com/games/the-creature/) for the [Week Sauce Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/weeksauce-3), and we enjoyed it enough to keep making games!

I have entered several game jams, which limit the amount of time you are committed to working on a game. It's a helpful practice in project management and prioritization, but it's also invigorating to overload my creativity under the pressure of a time limit.

I have entered several game jams on my own, including the worldwide [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/) where my game, [Judgement of Priest](https://supergobo.itch.io/judgement-of-a-priest?secret=y8iE62XuowSe3dRCjaB3YANzE8), placed 27th for audio and 39th for graphics out of 761 competition entries.

Most recently I made an arcade game made for the weekend-long [Mini Jame Gam #20](https://itch.io/jam/mini-jame-gam-20). The theme was **out of time** and must include the "special object," an **organ** (the musical instrument). Out of 47 entries _Out of Thyme_ was ranked 2nd overall, and was the highest ranking solo entry.

Earth Defense was one of the earliest games I finished. It was originally made in the [XNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA) framework and I later remade it using [Unity](https://unity.com/).

The game is available to play online or download for Windows on [Itch.io](https://supergobo.itch.io/earth-defense).
