# {frontmatter.title}

Many of my projects are interdisciplinary, combining my interests in programming, visual art, music production, and more. However, I've grouped them into the following collections for easier navigation.

	## [Web Development](/collections/web)
</ProjectHeader>

I am a software developer by trade and I specialize in web development. Aside from [rschubkegel.com](/), I've collected some of the other projects I've worked on.

	## Mobile Development
</ProjectHeader>

I have become very proficient with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) by working on the [BrokerBay](https://www.brokerbay.com/) mobile app as a contractor through [Silverpine](https://silverpine.com/). I have spearheaded several initiatives to improve the app, including:

- Speeding up average launch time by over 50% by refactoring <abbr title="asynchronous">async</abbr> logic
- Optimizing <abbr title="time to interactive">TTI</abbr> metrics by implementing skeleton loader components
- Adding frontend data caching using [Tanstack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest)

I don't usually touch hardware with a ten foot pole, but I worked on a couple of projects in school that made me feel like a "real" engineer.

My interest in video games inspired me to study computer science in college. Game development remains one of my favorite hobbies since it combines my interest in software development, visual art, music production, and psychology.
