# {frontmatter.title}

My first love (of hobbies) was art. My first canvas was my brother who I painted when I was still a toddler.

Since then I developed a love of drawing, painting, graphic design, and animation.

This is a small collection of my work.

	## Painting
</ProjectHeader>

One of my favorite forms of R&R is traditional painting. I've tried watercolor and gouache, but my favorite medium is acrylic. _Occasionally_, I share my work on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/theryguydraws/).
