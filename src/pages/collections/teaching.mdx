# {frontmatter.title}

I've taught some programming classes which has been a great way to practice my communications skills and review fundamental programming concepts.

	## High School Programming
</ProjectHeader>

I taught a high school elective at [Hill Creek Christian School](https://hillcreekchristian.org/) on _Python Programming and Computer Science_. I designed the entire curriculum from the ground up with the goal of developing students' high-level understanding and appreciation of digital technologies. All of the curriculum resources were compiled in a website built specifically for the course.

You can check out the course website at [hcc.rschubkegel.com](https://hcc.rschubkegel.com/).

For a summer, I was an online instructor at [Coding with Kids](https://www.codingwithkids.com/) where I taught camps and after-school classes in Python, C#, and Scratch.

I even taught photo editing with [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) for one camp!
