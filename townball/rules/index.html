<h3 id="equipment">Equipment</h3>
<ol start="5">
<li>The ball shall consist of cork, rubber, yarn, and leather. The cork center shall be one inch in diameter, followed by a layer of rubber so that the cork center and rubber together measure no less than six and one-eighth and no more than six and three-eighths inches in circumference. The cork and rubber core shall then be wrapped with yarn until the circumference measures no less than nine-and-three-eighths and no more than nine-and-a-half inches. The ball shall then be covered in one piece of leather stitched together so that it measures no less than nine and five-eighths and no more than nine and seven-eighths inches in circumference, and weighs no less than four and seven-eighths and no more than five and one-eighth avoirdupois ounces.</li>
<li>The bat shall be made of wood, the thickest part thereof not exceeding eight inches in circumference, and shall be of any length so as to suit the batter.</li>
<li>Fielders’ gloves must measure no more than three inches in length from the base of the fingers to the tip, and no more than eight inches in width from the side of the index finger closest to the thumb, to the side of the pinkie farthest from the same.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-playing-field">The Playing Field</h3>
<ol start="8">
<li>The playing field shall be a square marked out by five cylindrical wooden stakes inserted upright into the ground, each of which being at least two feet in length and one inch in diameter.</li>
<li>First stake shall be forty two feet from the batting point, second stake sixty eight feet from first, third stake one hundred ten feet from second, fourth one hundred ten feet from third, and the home stake one hundred ten feet from fourth, all laid out in right angles from the batting point to home, in a counterclockwise direction.</li>
<li>The pitching line shall be fifty-two feet from and parallel to the line formed by the batting point and first stake, on the same side of said line as second stake.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="innings">Innings</h3>
<ol start="11">
<li>The teams shall alternate between batting and fielding. Each time the teams switch between batting and fielding, and then from fielding to batting, will constitute an inning.</li>
<li>Each inning will consist of one out per side.</li>
<li>If at any point at the end of an inning, one of the teams is leading the other by at least five runs after having scored at least eight, or has scored a total of at least thirteen runs, then that team shall be considered the winner. In the case that both teams have exceeded thirteen runs in the same inning, then the team with the higher score at the end of that inning wins. In the case that there is a tie at the end of that inning, then the game will continue one inning at a time until there is no longer a tie at the end of an inning. The team with the higher score at the end of that inning wins.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="rounds">Rounds</h3>
<ol start="14">

<li>Stakerunners in physical contact with a stake that he has legally progressed to shall be considered safe. A stakerunner shall not be considered safe on a stake that a previous runner has not yet progressed to.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="pitching">Pitching</h3>
<ol start="19">
<li>A pitch is a legal toss or throw in the batter’s direction. For every batter that the pitcher faces, the pitcher must wait until the batter is ready before throwing the first pitch.</li>
<li>For every pitch, the pitcher may not make physical contact with the ground on the batting-point-side of the pitching line until after he releases the ball.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="batting">Batting</h3>
<ol start="21">
<li>The batter may attempt to advance to first stake at any time after at least one ball has been pitched to him, whether or not the ball has been hit. A batter who leaves the batter’s box before the first pitch leaves the pitcher’s hand may not legally advance to the first stake.</li>
<li>If a batter attempts to hit the ball more than once for any given pitch, or if the batter attempts to hit the ball after the ball has stopped moving, the batter is out.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-zone">The ZONE</h3>
<ol start="23">
<li>There shall be a fourteen inch wide by twenty four and a half inch high rectangular zone facing the pitcher placed five feet behind the batting point, the bottom of which being fourteen and a half inches from the ground, for which if the ball is legally pitched into without first hitting the ground, a fielder, or the batter, or in the case the ball would have hit the zone, except that the batter interfered with the pitch by causing his body to obstruct the path of the ball, the batter is out.</li>
<li>If a batter attempts to advance to first stake without hitting the ball, and if the ball is pitched into the zone before the batter reaches first stake, then the batter is out.</li>
<li>If the batter hits the zone with his bat while batting then the batter is out.</li>
<li>If a batter attempts to hit a pitched ball after it hits part of the zone, including the leg or stand, or after it passes the plane formed by the zone, then the batter is out.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-batters-box">The Batter’s Box</h3>
<ol start="27">
<li>There shall be an eight by five foot rectangular batters box measured five feet behind and four feet on either side of the batting point for which a batter or stakerunner who is touching the ground therewithin, whether with his body or with his bat, shall be considered safe.</li>
<li>A stakerunner may not retreat to the batter’s box after a new batter has entered therewithin.</li>
<li>If a fielder enters the batter’s box at any time during a pitch while the batter is in the batter’s box before the ball hits the zone, passes the plane formed by the zone, hits the batter, is hit by the batter, or comes to a complete stop, then the batter shall be awarded an automatic homerun, he himself scoring along with any other stakerunners who may be on stake at the time.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="runouts">Runouts</h3>
<ol start="30">
<li>A batter or stakerunner that is hit by the ball while not safe is out.</li>
<li>A stakerunner tagged by a fielder with his glove possessing the ball while he is not safe, is out, provided that the fielder maintains possession of the ball until the conclusion of the play.</li>
<li>If two runners occupy the same stake, then neither is considered safe.</li>
<li>If a stake runner intentionally makes contact with two stakes at once, he is out.</li>
<li>If a stakerunner or batter exits the agreed upon playing area while stakerunning, he is out.</li>
<li>If a batter or stakerunner intentionally handles the ball while in play, he is out.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="knocking-the-stake">Knocking the Stake</h3>
<ol start="36">
<li>If while in the process of advancing from stake to stake, a stakerunner either dislodges or causes a stake to fall over, then the stakerunner must set that stake back upright at the place where it was originally stationed before he may legally advance to the next stake. If a stakerunner knocks over more than one stake during his progression from stake to stake, then he must return each stake to an upright position, starting with the stake that he last knocked over before resuming advancement starting from the stake he last set back up.</li>
<li>If a stake falls over after a runner had already advanced to the next stake, then the stake will not be considered to have been knocked over by that runner.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="obstruction">Obstruction</h3>
<ol start="38">
<li>If in the opinion of the umpire a fielder not associated with a play intentionally obstructs the path of a stakerunner, then the stake runner shall be granted the stake to which he was attempting to advance or retreat to, or in the case that in the umpires opinion the runner would have advanced more than one stake on the play, then the corresponding number of stakes shall be granted him.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="strikes">Strikes</h3>
<ol start="39">
<li>If the batter attempts to hit the ball with his bat and misses, and if a member of the opposing team catches the ball on that pitch without it first hitting the ground, then a strike shall be called against the batter, provided that the fielder maintains possession of the ball until the conclusion of the play.</li>
<li>If the batter hits the ball and does not attempt to advance to first, then a strike shall be called against the batter.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="strikeouts">Strikeouts</h3>
<ol start="41">
<li>A third strike caught in the air is an out, provided that the fielder maintains possession of the ball until the conclusion of the play.</li>
<li>If a batter who has been pitched to has not completed an at-bat before an inning ends, he shall resume his at-bat in the subsequent inning with a new count of strikes.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="forceouts">Forceouts</h3>
<ol start="43">
<li>If a batter hits the ball with the bat on the third strike, then the batter is obligated to attempt to advance to first stake, provided that the batter has not already flown out or zoned out on the hit. If another runner occupies first stake on the third strike that has been hit by the batter, then the runner on first must advance to second, and likewise for any runner on any subsequent stake for which the runner is forced to run by a runner behind him who is also forced to advance to the stake that the subsequent runner is occupying.</li>
<li>If a batter or a runner is forced to run on a third strike, then such a runner can be put out if a fielder knocks the stake to which the batter or runner is forced to advance to with the ball, whether thrown or tagged, or, provided that the fielder maintains possession of the ball until the conclusion of the play, with a glove that possesses the ball.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="flyouts">Flyouts</h3>
<ol start="45">
<li>A batted ball caught in the air is an out, provided that the fielder maintains possession of the ball until the conclusion of the play.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="illegal-pitches">Illegal Pitches</h3>
<ol start="46">
<li>If a pitcher delivers an illegal pitch to a batter, then no strike, zone out, or fly out will be called against the batter on that pitch.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="balks">Balks</h3>
<ol start="47">
<li>If a pitcher takes a step toward the batting point so as to pitch the ball to the batter, then the pitcher must pitch the ball before any of the stakerunners, including the batter, can be put out.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="ground-rules">Ground Rules</h3>
<ol start="48">
<li>In the case that a ball pitched to the batter hits the batter, then the ball shall be in play without any reservations. Similarly, if a pitched ball hits any part of the zone other than at the rectangle, or in the case that the ball bounces on the ground or off the batter and then his the rectangle, that ball shall be considered to be in play.</li>
<li>Runs that score before an out is made in an inning shall count except in the case of a fly out or force out. In the case of a fly out or force out, no runs that take place after the moment the ball was hit shall count. In every other case, runs that score after the moment an out is made in an inning shall not count.</li>
<li>If a batter hits the ball onto the ground and as a result, the ball exits the playing area on account of the hit, then the batter and any concurrent stake runners shall be granted the stake that they were advancing to at the time the ball was hit, and two more stakes. If a batter hits the ball in the air out of the playing area, then the batter shall be granted an automatic homerun, and thus scoring, along with any stakerunners who were on stake at the time that the ball had been hit. If a ball leaves the playing area without having been hit, then runners will be granted the stake that they were advancing to at the time the ball went out of play, and one more stake.</li>
<li>As long as the ball is in the playing area, the ball shall be considered live at all times, and runners may advance from stake to stake at will, in keeping with the rules outlined in this document. No timeouts shall be granted during play, except in the case of injury or for some other reason deemed necessary by the umpire.</li>
<li>The 13 players that make up a townball team shall be the same 13 players throughout the duration of the game, except in the case that it is impossible for a particular player to continue playing for the duration of the game. If the umpire agrees that it is impossible for a player to continue playing for the duration of the game, then and only then will a substitute player be introduced, according to the ground rules set before the game agreed upon by both captains.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="sportsmanship">Sportsmanship</h3>
<ol start="53">
<li>The set of rules written in this document shall be considered the complete set of rules for 21st Century Townball, and any play during a legal game of the same that does not break nor disobey these rules shall be considered legal, and shall be considered so until a rule is otherwise added to this set.</li>
<li>Any rule outlined in this document can be spontaneously modified during or before a game, if agreed upon by both captains. However, unless otherwise agreed upon by both captains, each rule in this document shall be considered binding during game play and shall be followed in all cases, and no rule changes can be made if not agreed upon by both captains.</li>
