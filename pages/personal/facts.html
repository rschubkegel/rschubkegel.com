            Let's face the facts and talk about birds.
            Here is a list of realities we <em>know</em> about birds:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>They aren't who they say they are</li>
            <li>They work for the government</li>
            <li>They fly and spy (suspiciously)</li>
            <li>Their entire lives are lies</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Obviously education has failed us. This is not a big
            surprise because schools are run by the government.
            We must be aware. We must not settle for inaction.
            We must educate those who are misinformed. Only when we are
            woke to what's real can we fly on wings like eagles.
