# Web Programming

This class focused on the technology of the web, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. It also covered HTTP requests and REST APIs.

- [REST API](#rest-api)
- [Interactive JavaScript](#interactive-javascript)
- [CSS Zen Garden](#css-zen-garden)

## REST API

<a class="header-link" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/304_pages/api/index.html">view page</a>

The final class project had us interact with a web <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr>. Since I am a prolific [Trello](https://trello.com/) user, I chose to work with their interface. This project focused more on back-end development than front-end.

_Note: I did not get this working due to my busy class schedule. However, I have since created a Python program that successfully interacts width Trello's <abbr title="representational state transfer">REST</abbr> API. [Check it out here!](https://github.com/rschubkegel/assignment-scraper)_

## Interactive JavaScript

<a class="header-link" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/304_pages/js/index.html">view page</a>

This is the first class project where JavaScript was required; our page just needed to be modified somehow by a script. Since it was fairly easy to implement, I chose to recreate [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in the browser.

## CSS Zen Garden

<a class="header-link" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/304_pages/zen/index.html">view page</a>

In order to practice using CSS, we re-styled a pre-existing web page. We were allowed to style the page any way we wanted as long as we did not edit the HTML (aside from making relative links absolute).
