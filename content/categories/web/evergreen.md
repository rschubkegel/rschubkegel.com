[Evergreen.ink](https://evergreen.ink/) is an interactive fiction writing platform made by by [Big River Games](https://bigrivergames.com/). It allows users to write their own [choose-your-own-adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure) story with an intuitive interface, including a unique story diagram to visualize complex stories.

I was responsible for the entire frontend including UX design, application programming, CI/CD pipeline for testing and deploying ([Jest](https://jestjs.io/) + [GH Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)), and server ([Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/)) configuration on [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/).

I am most proud of the story diagram created with [D3](https://d3js.org/); it provides an easy-to-understand visual of even the most complex interactive fiction stories.
