My passion for games started with the Nintendo GameCube which I **loved** playing with my older brother. I would dream about making my own games, creating experiences that didn't exist yet. Late in middle school I started making games with [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), then graduated to [XNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA) in high school. Before graduating I had created several small game with [Unity](https://unity.com/) and developed a passion for game design.

To this day, I still love making games since they provide a unique opportunity to blend my interests of programming, art, music, and psychology. I hope you enjoy one or more of the projects I've made!
