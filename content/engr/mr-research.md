### MR Research

I was the team manager of 6 students working with [Daimler Trucks of North America](https://northamerica.daimlertruck.com/) to research the utility of Microsoft's [Hololens 2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens/hardware) for Daimler's servicing intake process. We developed small-scale text input applications in mixed reality using [Unity](https://unity.com/) and Microsoft's Mixed Reality Toolkit. After having users test these applications we were able derive insights about the unique user experience of the Hololens headset, providing our client with valuable information about the efficacy of MR in their truck servicing process.
