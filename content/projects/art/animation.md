I love bringing drawings to life through animation. Since it takes so much time, the only chance I've had to create the "illusion of life" has been for school credit.

In high school, I took a class taught by a former Disney animator. My rendition of the classic "bouncing ball" animation was featured in a student compilation that placed in the [Walt Disney Family Museum's](https://www.waltdisney.org/) annual animation competition for beginners!

In college, I took an into animation class and 2D animation class, both of which gave me the chance to use professional equipment that I couldn't afford before.

Some of my favorite animations are compiled here for you enjoyment!
