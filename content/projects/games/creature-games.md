The first time I entered a game jam with someone else, we didn't pull off the game in time. However, we loved the experience and were inspired to make more games together.

Not long after that we teamed up with another friend and created [The Creature](https://supergobo.itch.io/the-creature) for the [Week Sauce Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/weeksauce-3). That game was the inception of [Creature Games Studio](https://www.creaturegamesstudio.com/) where I continue to work on new game projects.
