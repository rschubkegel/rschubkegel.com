I have entered several game jams, which limit the amount of time you are committed to working on a game. It's a helpful practice in project management and prioritization, but it's also invigorating to overload my creativity under the pressure of a time limit.

I have entered several game jams on my own, including the worldwide [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/) where my game, [Judgement of Priest](https://supergobo.itch.io/judgement-of-a-priest?secret=y8iE62XuowSe3dRCjaB3YANzE8), placed 27th for audio and 39th for graphics out of 761 competition entries.
