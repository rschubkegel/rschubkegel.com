Earth Defense was one of the earliest games I finished. It was originally made in the [XNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA) framework and I later remade it using [Unity](https://unity.com/).

The game is available to play online or download for Windows on [Itch.io](https://supergobo.itch.io/earth-defense).
