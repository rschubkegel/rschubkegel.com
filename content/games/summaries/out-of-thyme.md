### Out of Thyme

An arcade game made for the weekend-long [Mini Jame Gam #20](https://itch.io/jam/mini-jame-gam-20) made in Godot. The theme was **out of time** and must include the special object, an **organ (the musical instrument)**. Out of 47 entries _Out of Thyme_ was ranked 2nd overall, and was the highest ranking solo entry.
