### Zoombingo

What happens when you are a web developer whose family keeps in touch with Zoom calls each week? In my case, I created a web app here you can play a game bingo while watching for peoples' individual quirks.

The app was built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) on the frontend, a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) server on the backend, [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for the database, and [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for deployment.
