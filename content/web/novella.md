### Novella2020.com

[Novella](https://novella2020.com/) tells a _story_ with every sneaker by designing each pair after a unique artisan. I built the entire frontend using [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Liquid](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/liquid), and [GreenSock](https://greensock.com/).

The frontend is integrated with Shopify, Campaign Monitor, and a custom backend.
