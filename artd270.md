# Web Design

This class focused on the design aspects of <abbr title="user experience">UX</abbr> rather than the technology. The class encouraged the process of sketching, wireframing, and _then_ building a functional website. All projects were completed during the spring 2021 semester.

- [Product Page](#product-page)
- [Virtual Card](#virtual-card)
- [Website Redesign](#website-redesign)

## Product Page

This was probably my favorite project. Our task was to create a product launch page, but I requested to make a "product" page for bagels instead of a _real_ product. Choosing tasty images and adding silly text made this project tons of fun, but I still learned a lot because we were required to use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to make the final page.

## Virtual Card

This project was designed to learn/practice HTML and CSS. Everything was coded by hand, so we didn't spend time polishing it (making it responsive, adding transitions, etc.) because the class is geared toward design students.

## Website Redesign

The first task of this project was to find a website to redesign. I chose the [website of the Vatican](https://www.vatican.va/content/vatican/en.html) for two reasons: 1) I attended an Anglican church throughout college and have an interest in the relationship between traditional Christianity and technology, and 2) the website is severely outdated and in need of renovation. My design process focused on the potential users of the site and how to help them accomplish their goals.

### User Personas
