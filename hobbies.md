# Hobbies

## Game Development

One of my passions is game development, which unites several of my other hobbies. I love game jams and small indie projects. You can see all my published games on [my itch.io page](https://supergobo.itch.io/).

My most notable game is an entry for [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/) 43, a 48-hour game making competition. Out of a total of 761 competition entries, my game _Judgement of a Priest_ placed 27th for audio and 39th for graphics.

## Music Production

Some of my currently published music, representing a small selection of hundreds of songs I have made. I started producing as a young teenager under the alias [Shoobie Doobie](https://open.spotify.com/embed/artist/6YrSdl1dy1dDxZETIxW7n5) (a nickname my coach gave me when I played baseball). Most recently I have begun producing music with my wife under the alias [The Newbkegels](https://thenewbkegels.bandcamp.com).
