Astro is a modern web framework that's perfect for building content-rich websites. In this post, I'll walk you through the basics of setting up an Astro project and using content collections.

## What Makes Astro Special?

Astro's key features include:

- **Component Islands**: Only ship JavaScript when needed
- **Content Collections**: Type-safe content management
- **Framework Agnostic**: Use React, Vue, Svelte, or plain HTML
- **Built-in Optimizations**: Image optimization, CSS bundling, and more

## Setting Up Content Collections

Content collections are one of Astro's most powerful features. They allow you to:

1. Define schemas for your content
2. Get type safety across your application
3. Query and filter content programmatically

Here's how you can get started with content collections in your Astro project.

## Conclusion

Astro provides a great developer experience with its content collections and component islands architecture. It's particularly well-suited for content-heavy websites and blogs like this one.
