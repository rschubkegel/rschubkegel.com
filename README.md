# Portfolio Website

This website has gone through several tech stacks, all of which are archived in different branches of the repo. The current stack includes [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) for frontend and [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) for static site generation.

Commits pushed to `main` will trigger a workflow that regenerates the site and serves it at https://rschubkegel.github.io/.
