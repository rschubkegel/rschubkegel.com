## Engineering Projects

### Senior Design

I am currently the team manager of 6 students working with Daimler Trucks of North America. We were tasked with researching the utility of the Microsoft Hololens for the Daimler's truck servicing intake process. We are developing a proof of concept in <abbr title="mixed reality">MR</abbr> using Unity and Microsoft's <abbr title="mixed reality toolkit">MRTK</abbr>.

### Servant Engineering

Our team explored the design challenge of helping visually impaired individuals navigate the world around them. As part of our human-centered design approach to tackling this challenge, we developed a high-level user story to frame our design efforts: "As a visually impaired person, I want to identify common objects and read text and symbols on signs as I navigate my environment."

## Web Design

### Portfolio Site

<a class="header-link" href="https://github.com/rschubkegel/rschubkegel.github.io">view source</a>

This website started out as a landing page for projects made in my [CSIS 304 class]({{ site.baseurl }}/csis304). I kept adding to it until it became a monolithic collection of HTML tags, inline CSS, and sluggish JavaScript. After copy/pasting HTML headers for months, I resolved to find a more sustainable and elegant way to build my portfolio site.

I first looked at [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a JavaScript framework built on [React.js](https://reactjs.org/). I dove into its many unfamiliar features including React, JSX, TypeScript, Sass, and more. After an overwhelming amount of learning to re-generate _the same static website_, I came to the conclusion that Next.js was too heavy-weight for my purposes. I didn't need the fine-grained control of React or the powerful dynamic routing of Next, I just needed a framework to turn my portfolio site from <abbr title="write everything twice">WET</abbr> development into <abbr title="don't repeat yourself">DRY</abbr> development.

In search of a lightweight static site generator, I looked at both [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I chose to use Jekyll since that's what my host service, [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), is built on. Jekyll retains the beauty of templating while encouring the use of other features like [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) blogging and [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki) processing. Feel free to [check out the source code](https://github.com/rschubkegel/rschubkegel.github.io) for the current version of this site.
