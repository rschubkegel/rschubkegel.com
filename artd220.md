# Typography

This page showcases some school projects from ARTD 220. The class explored type anatomy, page layout, hierarchy, and more. All projects were completed during the fall 2019 semester.

- [Constitutional Amendment](#constitutional-amendment)
- [Type Anatomy Exercise](#type-anatomy-exercise)
- [Twenty-seventh Letter](#twenty-seventh-letter)

## Conference Branding

Starting with just the required text for a design conference, I created a logo, poster design, and website layout (only the poster is included). I found the background image on [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/), my typical source of high quality photos.

<div class="row justify-content-center">
  <div class="col-sm-9 col-md-6">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/typography/made-by-humans.jpg" alt="poster design"/>
  </div>
</div>

## Constitutional Amendment

This project encouraged me to research a constitutional amendment of interest and create a poster to raise awareness for it. I chose the fourth amendment and focused on a modern issue it addresses: location privacy. The text is taken directly from Justice Roberts of the Supreme Court when it ruled against using cellular triangulation without a warrant.

<div class="row justify-content-center">
  <div class="col-sm-9 col-md-6">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/typography/amendment.png" alt="poster design"/>
  </div>
</div>

## Type Anatomy Exercise

The goal of this exercise was to create images using only type. The forms could be cropped, transformed, or stretched, but the essence of the typeface had to be preserved.

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;">
  {% for i in (1..10) %}
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/typography/anatomy/{{ i }}.png" alt="type anatomy exercise {{ i }}" style="padding: 0;"/>
  {% endfor %}
</div>

## Twenty-seventh Letter

In this project, we were prompted to create a 27th letter of the alphabet. We were limited to making a new letter-form using the style of an existing typeface. I chose to make a character for silent usages of the letter "p".

<div class="row justify-content-center">
  <div class="col-sm-9 col-md-6">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/typography/twenty-seventh-letter.jpg" alt="twenty-seventh letter"/>
  </div>
</div>
